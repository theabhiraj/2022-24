# Restaurant-Management-System-DBMS-project
Our project is restaurant management system, where we provide all the details that a manager needs to run the restaurant from ordering the food to generating bill and payment. In our project only an authorised person i.e. manager can login, He can see the data of customers and employee. He can also add, update or delete customer. We have table masters who assigns table to the customers and chef who prepares food, also main feature is we calculate the time taken to serve customer food after order is placed. And we also have preparation time for each food individually. Chef also gets bonus if he prepares food early than expected, and customers are given more discount if food is delivered to them late as reward for their patience. We allocate table based on members and table masters does that job, also customer can prebook their table. Also, we keep a record of the employee who have left their table, like which employee left and when. Menu is displayed based on categories, like food with same category are displayed together. We also have record of increase in the price or ratings, like if food price is increased then old price and new price, and also ratings of food, like which food is trending and hitting our restaurant or which food is not doing well And we generate bill automatically based on order items, and we have got many payment options like cash, card, paytm, etc.
